# lwt_summit_resources
Gathering together some assets we developed at the Lesbians Who Tech summit, February 2015

Here are some assets we put together to supplement the Google Docs already created. Despite making progress, we ran into some technical difficulties with the Rails. 

* [Immigration Tracker Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1km8xmO73AE2u3RZnE5X0_7brzioLwM8wkh5n7CcJTgU/edit#gid=2037953074)
* [Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/ImmigrationTracker/lwt_summit_resources/blob/master/ImmigrationTrackrERD2.jpeg) Database architecture concepts
* [Passport seals](https://github.com/ImmigrationTracker/lwt_summit_resources/blob/master/stamps.jpg) background image
