# lwt_summit_resources
Gathering together some assets we developed at the Lesbians Who Tech summit, February 2015

* [Immigration Tracker Google Doc](https://github.com/ImmigrationTracker/lwt_summit_resources)
* [Entity Relationship Diagram](ImmigrationTrackrERD.pdf) Database architecture concepts
* [Passport seals](stamps.jpg)
